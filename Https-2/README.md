server responds only in strings and not in array and objects.

becoz in every lang there r diff data types in js is array 
in python is list 
..bt server cant take all it thats why string is a standard format.As string is same in all languages.
convert the string with JSON.stringify([7,9,7,5]);

//thts why in making  apps we send data in stringify way or accept it in parse.

npm install nodemon for not repeating node index.js everytime.it moniters the node application and the changes in it.
